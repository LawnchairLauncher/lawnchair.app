# Lawnchair Website

This is the official Lawnchair website made by [SuperDragonXD](https://github.com/SuperDragonXD). Provides information about us, the launcher, and more.

The website can be found at https://lawnchair.app; a development version can be found at https://lawnchair-launcher-site.glitch.me/.

## To-do list

While the website itself is good enough to provide information about us, it isn't complete yet. We still have plans to do, which can be found on [the lawnchair.app wiki](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair.app/wiki).
